# Traction Battery High Voltage Wiring Harness Design (CATIA V5)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and routing of a *High Voltage (HV) traction battery wiring harness* for an electric vehicle using *CATIA V5 – Electrical Harness Design* workbench.  
The objective was to develop a *safe, serviceable, and standards-compliant HV harness* within the traction battery enclosure.

---

## 🔋 System Description
The traction battery assembly consists of multiple battery modules arranged inside a sealed enclosure.  
The HV harness distributes power and signals while maintaining safety, reliability, and serviceability.

### Harnesses Designed:
- *Traction Battery HV Harness*
- *Front EDU HVIL Harness*
- *Ancillary HVIL Harness*

## 🔧 Key Design Activities

### 1. HV Harness Routing
- Routed HV cables along the *battery enclosure perimeter*
- Maintained *minimum bend radius* and smooth curvature
- Avoided sharp edges and high-risk zones
- Ensured proper branching to each battery module

### 2. HV Safety Implementation
- Orange color-coded HV cables
- High Voltage Interlock Loop (*HVIL*) integrated
- Proper connector orientation and accessibility
- Maintained clearance between HV paths and other components

### 3. Packaging & Feasibility
- Routing optimized for compact battery packaging
- Considered vibration-prone and thermal zones
- Designed for future service and maintenance access

### 4. CATIA V5 Electrical Practices
- Multi-branchable harness architecture
- Bundle segment creation with supports and clips
- Connector placement aligned with module terminals
- Structured harness suitable for flattening and documentation
